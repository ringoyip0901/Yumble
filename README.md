# Yumble

This is a React/Redux app that is based on the concept of combining Yelp with an online dating application, such as Tinder. Users can look up restaurants by entering the search keywords, and live data will then be retrieved from the Yelp API! Click the right icon to say "Yes", and then left one to say "No" :) 

Under Favorites, scroll the icons to to the right and hover to the icon you want, the important information of that restaurant will be shown on the yellow sticky note!
